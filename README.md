# discord-screenaudio

A very WIP custom discord client that supports streaming with audio on Linux,
made possible by the
[great work](https://github.com/edisionnano/Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux)
of [@edisionnano](https://github.com/edisionnano) and the
[Rohrkabel library](https://github.com/Soundux/rohrkabel) by
[@Curve](https://github.com/Curve).

The purpose of this project is **not** to provide an alternative to the original
Discord client. Rather, it should be used in addition to the original client in
case you want to stream something, maybe used with a second account. For
anything else, this client has way too many things that work less well than in
the original client.

## Known Issues

- Only works with **PipeWire**
- Only works on **X11**
- Can only share primary screen (no other screens or specific applications) (see
  [#1](https://github.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio/issues/1))

## Installation

You have multiple options:

- Install the Flatpak (recommended):
  `flatpak install de.shorsh.discord-screenaudio`
- If you are on Arch, you can build and install
  [`discord-screenaudio`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discord-screenaudio)
  from the AUR
- If you are on openSUSE, you can use the
  [Open Build Service package](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AVortexAcherontic&package=discord-screenaudio)
  by [@VortexAcherontic](https://github.com/VortexAcherontic)
- You can [build it yourself](#building-from-source)

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- Basic building tools
- CMake
- Qt5, QtWebEngine and Kf5Notifications
- **PipeWire** (it currently doesn't work with PulseAudio)
- Git

On Debian:
`apt install -y build-essential cmake qtbase5-dev qtwebengine5-dev libkf5notifications-dev pkg-config libpipewire-0.3-dev git`

### Building

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio.git
cd discord-screenaudio
```

Then, to build the program, run this in the source directory:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

And then to optionally install it, run:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```

## How it works

This whole project is based on
[this](https://github.com/edisionnano/Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux)
repository, which very nicely explains how to stream audio in the web version of
Discord. Basically: a virtual microphone is created which captures the
application audio, and this microphone is then fed to the Discord stream by
intercepting a API call of Discord.
