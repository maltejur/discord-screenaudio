# discord-screenaudio

A custom discord client that supports streaming with audio on Linux, made
possible by the
[great work](https://github.com/edisionnano/Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux)
of [@edisionnano](https://github.com/edisionnano) and the
[Rohrkabel library](https://github.com/Soundux/rohrkabel) by
[@Curve](https://github.com/Curve).

Unlike a lot of other solutions, the audio here is directly fed into the
screenshare and not passed to the user microphone
([see explanation](#how-it-works)).

The purpose of this project is **not** to provide an alternative to the original
Discord client. Rather, it should be used in addition to the original client in
case you want to stream something, maybe used with a second account. For
anything else, this client has way too many things that work less well than in
the original client.

Technically this could be against
[Discord's TOS](https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord%E2%80%99s-services),
so be warned. Discord probably won't ban you for using this, but if they do I
told you and it's not my fault.

## Known Issues

- Only works with **PipeWire**
- Can only share primary screen on X11 (no other screens or specific
  applications) (see
  [#1](https://github.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio/issues/1))

## Installation

You have multiple options:

- Install the Flatpak (recommended):
  `flatpak install de.shorsh.discord-screenaudio`
- If you are on Arch, you can build and install
  [`discord-screenaudio`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discord-screenaudio)
  from the AUR
- If you are on openSUSE, you can use the
  [Open Build Service package](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=games%3Atools&package=discord-screenaudio)
  by [@VortexAcherontic](https://github.com/VortexAcherontic)
- You can [build it yourself](#building-from-source)

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- Basic building tools
- CMake
- Qt5 and QtWebEngine
- **PipeWire** (it currently doesn't work with PulseAudio)
- Git
- notification-daemon (optional, for basic desktop notifications)
- _Kf5Notifications (optional, for better notifications)_
- _KXMLGui and KGlobalAccel (optional, for keybinds)_

On Debian **as [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)**:<br>
`apt install -y build-essential cmake qtbase5-dev qtwebengine5-dev libkf5notifications-dev libkf5xmlgui-dev libkf5globalaccel-dev pkg-config libpipewire-0.3-dev git`

On Arch **as [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)**:<br>
`pacman -Sy --needed --noconfirm git cmake qt5-base qt5-webengine xdg-desktop-portal-impl pipewire knotifications kxmlgui kglobalaccel`

### Building

### Automatic install

**Supported distributions**:<br>
- Debian-based
- Arch-based

Choose your URL fetcher:

|   Package   |   URL                                                                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   curl      |   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio/master/scripts/install.sh)"  |
|   wget      |   sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio/master/scripts/install.sh)"    |
|   fetch     |   sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio/master/scripts/install.sh)"  |

**Forks**: Change the `user/repo` URL, if the repository supports automatic installation.<br>
**Important**: To use the basic desktop notification, append the `--basic-notifications` flag to the command.

### Manual install

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio.git
cd discord-screenaudio
```

Then, to build the program, run this in the source directory:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

And then to optionally install it, run:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```

## How it works

This whole project is based on
[this](https://github.com/edisionnano/Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux)
repository, which very nicely explains how to stream audio in the web version of
Discord. Basically: a virtual microphone is created which captures the
application audio, and this microphone is then fed to the Discord stream by
intercepting a API call of Discord.
